# Readme

The main script used in this project is run_analysis.R. It is the only script needed to perform the cleanup on the UCI HAR data, and must be placed in the main directory after the data is downloaded. Therefore it must be inside the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory. See CodeBook.md for more details.
